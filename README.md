## Responsive HTML e-mails

[Hermes](https://github.com/matcornic/hermes)  is the Go part of the great [mailgen](https://github.com/eladnava/mailgen) engine for Node.js. Check their work, it's awesome! It's a package that generates clean, responsive HTML e-mails and associated plain text fallback.

## Technology

Fresh is built with the [Echo 3.3](https://echo.labstack.com/) framework. We're
using [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as a data store.

## Bring your own front-end

GoWithWith is only a restful JSON API. If you'd like a ready made front-end for clients,
checkout [Hexagenal](https://github.com/escommunity/hexagonal). Or better yet, fork
this repo and build one on top of GoWithWith.

## Requirements

You need [Golang](https://golang.org/) `>=1.5.x` and you'll need a
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) `>=2.6` server running.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Gommunity/GoWithWith.git
$ cd GoWithWith
// install packages with go tools
```

## Configuration


Simply copy `.env-sample` to `.env` and edit as needed. __Don't commit `.env`
to your repository.__

## Running the app

```bash
$ go run !(*_test).go

Now you should be able to point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:3500/swagger/index.html and
see the documentation page.
